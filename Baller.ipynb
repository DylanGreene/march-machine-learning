    "\n",
    "  * \"season\" - this is the year of the associated entry in seasons.csv\n",
    "  * \"wteam\" - this identifies the id number of the team that won the game\n",

    "  * \"lteam\" - this identifies the id number of the team that lost the game\n",
    "  * \"lscore\" - this identifies the number of points scored by the losing team\n",
    "  * \"wfgm\" - field goals made\n",
    "  * \"wfga\" - field goals attempted\n",
    "  * \"wfgm3\" - three pointers made\n",
    "  * \"wfga3\" - three pointers attempted\n",

    "#### Seasons.csv\n",
    "This file identifies the seeds for all teams in each NCAA tournament, for all seasons of historical data. Thus, there are between 64-68 rows for each year, depending on the bracket structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * \"season\" - the year\n",
    "  * \"seed\" - this is a 3/4-character identifier of the seed, where the first character is either W, X, Y, or Z (identifying the region the team was in) and the next two digits (either 01, 02, ..., 15, or 16) tells you the seed within the region. For play-in teams, there is a fourth character (a or b) to further distinguish the seeds, since teams that face each other in the play-in games will have the same first three characters. For example, the first record in the file is seed W01, which means we are looking at the #1 seed in the W region (which we can see from the \"seasons.csv\" file was the East region). This seed is also referenced in the \"tourney_slots.csv\" file that tells us which bracket slots face which other bracket slots in which rounds.\n",
    "  * \"team\" - this identifies the id number of the team, as specified in the teams.csv file\n",

    "This file identifies the mechanism by which teams are paired against each other, depending upon their seeds. Because of the existence of play-in games for particular seed numbers, the pairings have small differences from year to year. If there were N teams in the tournament during a particular year, there were N-1 teams eliminated (leaving one champion) and therefore N-1 games played, as well as N-1 slots in the tournament bracket, and thus there will be N-1 records in this file for that season.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * \"season\" - the year\n",
    "  * \"slot\" - this uniquely identifies one of the tournament games. For play-in games, it is a three-character string identifying the seed fulfilled by the winning team, such as W16 or Z13. For regular tournament games, it is a four-character string, where the first two characters tell you which round the game is (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, or R6) and the second two characters tell you the expected seed of the favored team. Thus the first row is R1W1, identifying the Round 1 game played in the W bracket, where the favored team is the 1 seed. As a further example, the R2W1 slot indicates the Round 2 game that would have the 1 seed from the W bracket, assuming that all favored teams have won up to that point. The slot names are different for the final two rounds, where R5WX identifies the national semifinal game between the winners of regions W and X, and R5YZ identifies the national semifinal game between the winners of regions Y and Z, and R6CH identifies the championship game. The \"slot\" value is used in other columns in order to represent the advancement and pairings of winners of previous games.\n",
    "  * \"strongseed\" - this indicates the expected higher-seeded (lower seed number) team that plays in this game\n",
    "  * \"weakseed\" - this indicates the expected weaker-seeded team that plays in this game"
